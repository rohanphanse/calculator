# The Functional Calculator

An intuitive and easy-to-use web calculator with the power of functional programming languages and the terminal!

My goal for this project was to create a web calculator that offered standard calculator functions as well as more powerful features from programming languages through a simple and accessible syntax.

As a challenge to myself, I decided not to use any external libraries. The entire calculator including the parser, evaluation engine, and UI was implemented with a few thousand lines of JavaScript code!

**Math features:** linear algebra (e.g. `rref` and `eigen`), calculus (e.g. `diff` and `lim`), complex numbers, polynomial root solvers, 2D graphing with `plot`, 3D graphing with `plot3` 

**Physics and Chemistry features:** physical units and constants, molar masses, balance chemical equations with `bal`

**Functional programming features:** variables, regular and anonymous `@` functions, `map` and `filter`, type checking, lambda capture, currying, conditional logic, `trace` function calls

**Terminal features:** arrow keys move through history, `help` documentation, syntax highlighting, autocomplete

**Additional features:** locally save variables and functions, unit and base conversions
