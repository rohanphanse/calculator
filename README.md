# The Functional Calculator

An intuitive and easy-to-use web calculator with the power of functional programming languages and the terminal!

My goal for this project was to create a web calculator that offered standard calculator functions as well as more powerful features from programming languages through a simple and accessible syntax.

As a challenge to myself, I decided not to use any external libraries. The entire calculator including the parser, evaluation engine, and UI was implemented with around 2000 lines of JavaScript code!

**Functional programming features:** map, reduce, functions as first-class objects, anonymous functions, type checking, lambda capture, currying

**Terminal features:** up and down arrow keys move through history, use `help` on any function or keyword to learn how to use it

**Additional features:** option to locally save user-defined functions, base conversions, polynomial root solvers
